## Association Rules Mining [ARM]:

- As term itself suggests, association rules are statements that help discover relationships between seemingly independent relational databases.
- ARM is a Data Mining technique that finds patterns in data.
- ARM is suitable for non-numeric, categorical data and requires just a little bit more than simple counting.
